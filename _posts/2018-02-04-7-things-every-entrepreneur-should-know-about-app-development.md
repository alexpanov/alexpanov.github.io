The mobile app ecosystem started showing signs of future potential from
the day of its inception. It has been evolving at such a rapid pace
that it requires tremendous insightfulness to understand what’s right
and what’s not, what works and what doesn’t.
In order to achieve sustainable success in a competitive environment,
entrepreneurs must explore the true potential of app development.
In this blog post, I will chalk out some of the facts that every
businessman should know about app development.

### 1. There is no such thing as a bug-free app

Is it humanly possible to write a bug-free app? I think the practical answer to this question is pretty much a NO. It is not economically viable to make it happen. A software or an application does not run in isolation, rather it has platform dependencies. On top of that, the existence of libraries makes things even more complex.

If you want to build a bug-free app, you need to make sure that every library you use is also bug-free. Some things are simply possible on paper but not in reality.

You should not expect your developer to write bug-free code. Instead, put emphasis on giving your early adopters a functional product that can fix their problems. Some bugs come to surface when a software becomes functional and does not perform the way we expect.

I strongly believe that a software or technology cannot be perfect at any stage - there is always room for improvement. You should not stop looking for that space and areas which can be improved.

### 2. Luck has little to do with success

As a software developer and entrepreneur, I think that there are similarities between building an app and a business - both endeavors involve a key step: understanding the consumer, their problems and developing solutions that work.

A deep understanding of your users will help you craft a stunning design for your app. When I say luck has nothing to do with your success in developing an excellent app, I really mean it. Because it's the design which plays a decisive role in shaping the future of your app. You do not have control over luck; but, you have the freedom to create an incredible app design.

Most of the popular apps out there were coherently designed by considering the [User Interface](https://uxplanet.org/top-3-ui-design-trends-of-2018-d9d479615e61) (UI) and User Experience (UX). Along with visually appealing looks, users love to spend time on apps with quick and easy navigation. Therefore, it’s essential for an entrepreneur to understand the significance of UI/UX design.

The UI design deals with the graphic design and overall presentation of an app while understanding the mind of end-users. UX, on the other hand, addresses all the elements associated with users’ interaction with the app. A good UX design focuses on increasing user satisfaction and trust by incorporating simplicity and usability.

### 3. A new business app needs to be 10 times better than the existing ones

Ben Horowitz, CEO of Opsware, says,
> “The primary thing that any technology startup must do is build a product that’s at least 10 times better at doing something than the current prevailing way of doing that thing. Two or three times better will not be good enough to get people to switch to the new thing fast enough or in large enough volume to matter.”

In a competitive environment, a startup has to be better than others in order to increase its chances of being successful. The same applies to a new app. Why do you need to be 10 times better?

Well, it’s hard to calculate how many times an app is better than the existing ones. When you build a solution which is clearly more attractive and beneficial, it becomes super easy to break through the power of inertia.  Being too early or too late can make you lost in the noise.

Don’t get caught up in the features you design. The continuously evolving market expectations will make it hard for you to convince yourself that you are 10 times or 20 times better from a feature perspective. Therefore, strive to make your app the best in every aspect and forget about the rest.

### 4. Starting small can end up big

It’s advisable for small-to-medium businesses to start small and build an app for a narrow audience. You can’t be sure whether your app will fly or die unless you make it available for users and let them validate.

When we study the struggle of some of the great entrepreneurs of our times, we came to know that all of them started small and materialize their dreams gradually with consistency, smart work, and a non-stop improvement process.

Entrepreneurs dreaming to write down another great success story in the world of app development should start small and find their way to big success by continuously refining their efforts.

Paul Graham, a venture capitalist, and entrepreneur expresses,
> “Sometimes the trick is to focus on a deliberately narrow market. It’s like keeping a fire contained at first to get it really hot before adding more logs.”

### 5. Users decide the fate of an app

There is no denying that it’s the user who determines whether or not your app is going to be a successful venture. This is why companies nowadays focus on the [user-centric approach to mobile design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-user-centred-approach-to-mobile-design-and-a-5-stage-process-for-you-to-use). I suggest that business owners and software developers must learn how to think like the mobile users they are building software for. Before you go ahead and do any design prioritization, it's crucial to pay attention to your users. The following questions can streamline this process for you:

* How do your users like to access the internet?
* How much time do they spend interacting with your app?
* What kind of devices do they use to access your app?
* What features can build a great user experience?
* What are the points where your users get frustrated and leave?

### 6. It’s essential to be adaptive

I think that the phrase “survival of the fittest” exquisitely applies to the landscape of app development. Your app can only be fit for an environment when it is designed to be adaptive. Things change quickly in this industry and you should not take success as a one-time effort.

The future of your app largely depends on your ability to be adaptable. One great advantage startups can enjoy over big companies is adaptability. It is usually difficult for a large company to shift strategy. Startups, on the other hand, can afford to make quick turns required to find the right opportunity.

### 7. It is not right to fear others stealing your idea

It takes years of struggle to build a brand - I can’t think of a big company or an immensely popular app which was built in the matter of a few months. Therefore, you shouldn’t pay too much attention to the fear that someone else will steal your idea and run with it. No one can have the same vision, motivation, and customer insight to build an app based on your idea.

I recommend that you go out and let more wise brains help you execute your idea. Your vision and dedication to create an amazing app will help you down the road.

### Conclusion

Conclusively speaking, great apps help users find the information they are looking for and perform tasks more easily and quickly. Mobile apps are here to stay and dominate the market. Since the rise of smartphones, mobile apps are quickly taking over important areas of our lives such as communication, entertainment, shopping, and more.

For entrepreneurs, it is absolutely crucial to understand the ins and outs of developing a business app. Things I have shared in the post will definitely help you understand and uncover the secrets of building a highly effective and profitable mobile app. I would love to hear what you think a passionate entrepreneur should know about app development.
