The only thing standing in your way from starting your own company is yourself.
This isn’t a trope, it’s actually true.

Deciding to take action is the hardest step until you actually
get it started and see the mountain of work you’ve got to do
to keep it running... but that’s another topic for another article.
Everything else is practically laid out for you.

You need a small budget to start up, some government fees
to make everything official, a computer you probably own anyway,
and whatever idea drove you to want to go into business
on your own in the first place.
It’s almost too easy nowadays, according to Forbes 90% of half-baked start-ups.

The tech side of business is often the most uncomfortable side for
a potential start up CEOs, like you. Yeah, I just called you a CEO
because you can give yourself that title when
you start your own business, so why not!
Often I find that people like you are comfortable talking about
marketing, personnel, money, and even the legal side of
owning a business... but if I were to ask you about the latest
in server technology I get the thousand yard stare.

The way services like these help start ups like yours is by deferring
the initial cost of the tech to a payment structure.
Sometimes they’re monthly, sometimes they’re charged by transaction,
other times they’re only charged at the end of a successful campaign.
Regardless of the payment structure, they save you much of
the initial start up costs.
A single budget server used to cost about $10k.
Compare that to a single server on Amazon EC2 will be as little
as $20/mo. You just don’t have to invest that much.
And it’s not only servers, it’s everywhere.

Hiring people to get the job done quickly and cheaply is
easier than ever too. Go to a freelancing website and just look
for yourself.
Getting your new start-up’s name out there is also pretty easy.
For five bucks on Fiverr, you can have a brand new logo.
Though traditional web based advertising is cost prohibitive,
guerrilla marketing can be accomplished through freelancers
on Upwork or Elance.

Start-ups with low budgets are risky, but not impossible.
Some have survived the test of time and money.
What can we learn from them? The surviving companies aren’t all
from the same industry, there’s no discernible pattern of hardship
that the CEO enjoyed, or hairline, or pinstripe suits, or anything.
They are usually smart about how they bootstrap.

In 2012, a start-up that helps start-ups was founded
called “Kickstarter”. Kickstarter uses free services
like Dropbox and Google Hangouts that have become synonymous with
the mobile-friendly start-up lifestyle that’s begun developing
the last few years. Kickstarter was smart about the way it started up,
and from its humble beginnings, now has over 250 million dollars
running through its system.

Starting up is easier than ever today, but starting up smartly needs
foresight. There are options for lower entry cost tech solutions,
as well as almost every other aspect that businesses need when they
are in their infancy.

Now ask yourself. If starting a business is easier than it has ever
been, why don’t you work so much on that idea of yours that you’ve
had for such a long time?
