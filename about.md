![Alex Panov](/images/profile.jpg){:class="img-responsive "}

I am an Entrepreneur and a Software Craftsman.
I help companies of various sizes to envision, **build and launch
software products**, be it web or mobile apps.

My team and I are focused on delivering the core functionality for
new products to go-to-market **in less than 2 months**.

We get involved in brainstorming before we even get hired to advance
the understanding and re-frame the problem and thus find **elegant and
simple solutions**.

I am fascinated by **Design Thinking** and modern technology.
These days I prefer to use JavaScript and React/React Native to squeeze
out maximum productivity once the problem and the solution have been
identified.

If you have a product or a service idea, I want to know.
Please **reach out** to me at [mail@alexpanov.me](mailto:mail@alexpanov.me)
or simply use the [contact](/contact) form.

-Alex
