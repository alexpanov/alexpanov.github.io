I am a Software Craftsman serving as Lead Software Developer at [Qoints](http://qoints.com).
 
Writing Clean Code using TDD is my passion. I preach what I practice and believe in fundamentals of the Software 
Craftsmanship. I also ramble a lot about Object Oriented Design.

Throughout my career, I have worked for a number of companies and learned 
a great deal from my colleagues about Software Development that I now want to share in my blog.
