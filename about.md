I am an Entrepreneur and a Software Craftsman on a journey of creating a successful company.

Writing Clean Code via TDD used to be my very important passion. However, last year I got bit by the Entrepreneurial zombie and have been transforming ever since.

I want to create great products that help people and improve their lives. Over the last 9 years, I got a lot of lessons on how not to do that. However, I also got a few very valuable ones on how to actually accomplish that.

I am now working with a couple of great people on creating my own company, [Vangify](http://vangify.com). We want to help people make better sports bets. Betting is something that I enjoy doing, so it was quite easy to get excited once I realized that it is one of my options.

I also want to help startups with great vision and make sure they don't waste valuable time and resources.

I worked for quite a few companies and learned a great deal about writing software and creating products. I now want to share that on my blog.
